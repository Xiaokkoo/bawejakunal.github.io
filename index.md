Hi I am Kunal Baweja, a final semester graduate student in [Computer Science]({{site.columbia.cs}}){:target="_blank"} at [Columbia University in the City of New York]({{site.columbia.university}}){:target="_blank"}.

I look forward to working on distributed systems, and scalable, secure and accessible technological solutions as a software engineer. Most recently I interned at [1010data](https://www.1010data.com){:target="_blank"} in summer of 2017 with the Systems Development Team.

I got my B.E.(Hons) in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, India in 2015 and moved to National University of Singapore as a Research Intern where I worked on research prototypes in web security and crypto-currencies.

Aside from computer science I am a hobbyist photographer and like to travel, exploring attractions with my lens. If it interests you please have a look at my work on [Flickr]({{site.contact.flickr}}){:target="_blank"}.

This is my small attempt at claiming a piece of the web and sharing my thoughts, so thanks for stopping by, hope you like it here. Please feel free to get in touch !
