Hi I am Kunal Baweja, a second semester graduate student in [Computer Science]({{site.columbia.cs}}){:target="_blank"} at [Columbia University in the City of New York]({{site.columbia.university}}){:target="_blank"}. I like to explore concepts in distributed computing, algorithms and [photography]({{site.social_links.flickr}}){:target="_blank"}.

This is my small attempt at claiming a piece of the web and sharing my thoughts, so thanks for stopping by, hope you like it here. Please feel free to get in touch !
