Hi! I am Kunal Baweja.

I am a software engineer interested in building scalable, secure and accessible technological solutions for large scale systems.

Aside from computer science I am a hobbyist photographer and like to travel, exploring attractions with my lens. If it interests you please have a look at my work on [Flickr]({{site.contact.flickr}}){:target="_blank"}.

This is where I share things I have been learning and working on. Thanks for stopping, hope you like it here. Please feel free to get in touch !
