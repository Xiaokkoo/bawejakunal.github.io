Hackathons are one of the entertaining and creative events for a developer.
However, completing a hackathon successfully can be a challenging activity for most of us because as mortals we tend to be focussed more on the prize/money rather than the objectives of creativity, learning and innovation.

For the learnathon of the week that is the first three days, I focussed on the [Data Science Track](https://learn.devfe.st/){:target="_blank"} to get familiar with data visualization and the statistics behind it. This was a fun learning experience divided into 6 programming modules that I completed over the four days
